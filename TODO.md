1. include candidate resume or a link to a publicly visible profile w/ resume info. possibly prompt the candidate to complete a resume before sending?
2. once the employer clicks accept we should show them a popup asking them to message the applicant... they can either "Send via Recovery Jobs" (aka circle. we'll have to force them through full signup if theyre gonna send via circle cause we need an email address to send a DM to the candidate on their behalf) or "Send via <candidate's contact method on file>".
3. We also need to include a link in all the email updates for the employer to close the job listing. We should also have this button on all the job pages the employer sees. So when theyre viewing a candidate they have a connect button already. they also need a "Close this job posting" When a posting is closed, we ought to delete it's post on circle.
4. When we delete a job in our system via /admin dashboard it would be nice to optionally remove any circle posts to that job if possible. someday we might have many reposts for the same job, idk.
5. Followup correspondence for employers who have pending candidates. after a day, send another email if they havent acted on a candidate. dont forget that they might still need to go through employer verification so we cant just assume we should be sending the candidate link. we might need to send them the employer verification link in the reminder. this can all be setup by adding scheduled event in the inngest workflow for job applications. it will just wait for a day and then check if the employer has viewed the candidate / passed / accepted or whatever, not sure.
6. candidates should be able to customize their resume for the job they are applying for before they send the application. We'd take the job description and ask Ai to do a review of their resume and suggest edits to make it better suited to the job they're applying for. we need to somehow translate the Ai output into actual text edits i suppose so like tool calling behavior.
7. URGENT: can we suppress notifications for job posts? I am testing the job posting features and each circle post is getting emailed to all our users as if it were a real job alert. it is not, obviously a real job alert. we should see if we can suppress notifications when a new circle post is created.
