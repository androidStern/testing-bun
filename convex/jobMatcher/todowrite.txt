Update the visible session plan (HUD) to show the user what you're working on.

Todos are for USER CLARITY at key moments, not for tracking every micro-step.

## When to Use This Tool

Use todoWrite ONLY at these moments:

1. **Start of a job-search mission** - When you're about to search for the first time in a session
2. **Major pivot** - User significantly changes direction (different industry, different requirements)
3. **Starting application help** - User picks a job and wants help applying (tailoring resume, next steps)

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Do NOT use todoWrite for:
- Simple Q&A ("What's a fair-chance employer?")
- Mid-search refinements ("Show me more warehouse jobs")
- Every tool call or micro-step
- Conversational turns
- Discovery questions before the first search

## Guidelines

- Keep it to 3-5 items maximum
- Update at milestones only, not every turn
- Complete existing todos before adding new ones
- Use short, scannable task names (3-8 words)
- Cancel tasks that become irrelevant when user pivots

## Task States

- pending: Task not yet started
- in_progress: Currently working on (only ONE at a time)
- completed: Task finished
- cancelled: Task no longer needed

## Examples

### CORRECT: Session start
User: "Help me find warehouse jobs"
*Calls todoWrite with:*
- Confirm job direction (in_progress)
- Get location if needed (pending)
- Search matching jobs (pending)
- Present results with next steps (pending)

### CORRECT: Major pivot
User: "Actually, let's try food service instead"
*Updates todos - cancels warehouse tasks, adds food service tasks*

### CORRECT: Application phase
User: "I want to apply to the Amazon warehouse job"
*Calls todoWrite with:*
- Review job requirements (in_progress)
- Tailor resume highlights (pending)
- Prepare application tips (pending)

### WRONG: Every search refinement
User: "Show me jobs with morning shifts only"
*Calls todoWrite* ← Don't do this. Just do the search.

### WRONG: Simple questions
User: "What does second-chance employer mean?"
*Calls todoWrite* ← Don't do this. Just answer.

### WRONG: After every tool call
*Calls searchJobs*
*Calls todoWrite to mark search complete*
*Calls askQuestion*
*Calls todoWrite to mark question asked*
← This is spammy. Only update at milestones.

## Key Principle

The todo list is a heads-up display for the user, not your internal task tracker.
Use it sparingly so it stays meaningful.
